            <p className="text">Lisa Federico, an experienced travel professional, founded Academy Travel as a full
                service travel agency in 1996. She also established a Disney focused division, MickeyVacations.com, and
                became one of the first Disney focused agencies in the country. She then trained a team of agents to
                specialize in planning Disney vacations. Lisa has received many accolades, including 2017 Travel
                Professional of the Year.

                Throughout the years, Academy Travel has focused on providing quality travel service, while working hard
                to assure that our clients receive the lowest available prices, and customized itinerary assistance.
                Lisa has built a leadership team with years of experience, plus a team of agents across the country that
                genuinely cares about their clients.

                As one of the original “EarMarked” travel agency partners with Disney Destinations, our agency has
                earned EarMarked status every year. And we are extremely proud to be one of only a 3 DIAMOND level
                Disney EarMarked Travel Companies in the country. Our team of agents are trained to always provide the
                lowest available pricing, to Disney or anywhere in the world.

                Academy Travel also has a team of agents that specialize in other destinations, such as Hawaii, Europe,
                South Africa, Australia & New Zealand. Plus of course Cruises, Caribbean, Mexico, Costa Rica, and other
                destinations throughout our beautiful world.

                Our website, AcademyTravel.com, will be continually updated with specials in the future, so watch for
                enhancements to better service you. This website is designed to be informative, to help you dream of
                where you want to go, and where the deals are. This is not a booking engine, because there’s nothing
                better than a trained agent assisting you with your plans, like your own personal VIP Agent, and we’ll
                save you hours of time researching. We’ll do the research for you, at no cost to you for our time.

                Thank you for reaching out to your Academy Travel AGENT when you’re ready to book your next dream
                vacation.

                If you don’t have an Academy Travel Agent yet, we would be happy to select an agent near you that
                specializes in the destination you want to visit on your next vacation.</p>
